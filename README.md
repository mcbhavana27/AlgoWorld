# AlgoWorld

``` We created this as part of our AAD course project.Our motive is to make a
book that consists of a description of algorithms used in various fields. We intend
to give the reader an overall idea about the algorithm to the extent possible and
give necessary technical details about it. We will be giving appropriate references
wherever necessary for the reader to explore more about their desired algorithms.
The book will be filled with many intriguing puzzles and astonishing facts nearing
the end of the chapter that will lighten the mood of the book.
The chapters in the book will come from various diverse fields such as
security, customer focussed sectors, some google functionalities, and also many
topics which involve a great deal of core subjects like electronics, biology, maths
etcetera. Since all these topics are diverse, we have included some small detours at
the end of every major topic. We intend to keep the reader engaged and spice
things up by our motto of beauty in diversity
Towards the end of the book, we intend to provide the reader with basic
algorithms in the field of data structures and programming languages that will help
beginners as well as any reader for immediate reference. These will be included in
the glossary with some minimal explanation. Last but not least , we have added
some references for the reader to explore more about any topic they are interested
in. Enjoy the experience of a beautiful world, The ​ Algo’s World​ !!! ```
